# MLOPS---Deployment-of-ML-model-using-Amazon-Sagemaker
Diabetes prediction model
The objective of this project is to automate the deployment of ML models into the cloud using Amazon sagemaker.
Diabetes prediction dataset::
The data is taken form https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database. It has 768 rows and 9 coulmns
Features are as follows 
1. Pregnancies	
2. Glucose
3. BloodPressure
4. SkinThickness
5. Insulin
6. BMI	
7. DiabetesPedigreeFunction
8. Age

Outcome: It has values o and 1. O refers to No diabetes and 1 refers to diabetes 

XgBoost Algorithm is trained by using the Diabetest prediction dataset, to predict whether the person has a diabetes or not, then this trained model is deployed into the production environment.
